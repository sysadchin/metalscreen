Metalscreen
-----------

This original intention was to develop a wrapper for automagically creating new
windows in the Linux utility 'screen'. After some research, I realized that
screen wasn't well suited for this. 

My efforts eventually involved switching to the 'tmux' utility. This script is
now considered 'obsolute' and/or 'defunct'. Its successor is labeled
'tmuxscript.sh' within the bugfree-octo-batman repository.
